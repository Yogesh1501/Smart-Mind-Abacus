        <p>Whole Brain Development – The Outlook is Bright When Left Brain Meets<br>
            Right Most brain development in children occurs primarily before the age<br>
            of 14, with much of that development taking place in the first several years<br> 
            of life. Children retain significant “neuroplasticity”, meaning brain<br>
            adaptability that allows growth and inter-connection of brain neurons.<br>
             The Program is designed to develop the integrated and motoring functions from <br>
             both sides of the brain. When children manipulate the beads of the<br>
             Abacus, communication between the hands and the brain stimulates the <br>
              brain’s right and left hemispheres. The right hemisphere – abstract <br>
              side – creates an image memory of the beads on the Abacus while the left hemisphere – logical side – applies the requisite rules <br>
              to perform the calculation. Because the right hemisphere of the brain is much faster than the left, when the students exercise the right<br>
             side through ‘visualization’, this results in strengthening the right-brain capabilities such as</p>
