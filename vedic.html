                <p>Vedic mathematics has origin from the fourth veda called “Atharva Veda”. Vedic mathematics is a system of<br>
                    mathematics which consists a list of basic 16 sutras. Vedic mathematics was introduced by “Hindu Scholar”<br>
                    of mathematics in the early age of 20th century. The calculating strategies provided by Vedic mathematics are<br>
                     very creative and useful which can be applied in a number of ways to calculate various methods in arithmetic and <br>
                    Algebra.</p>
